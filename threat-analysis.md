## Threats

The following threats have been taken into account during the system design and development.  As other threats are identified they will be added here along with an analysis of them. `

The _required operational mitigation_ is generally the an action that should be taken by one or more of the people involved in operating the backup system.  Normally that action is included in a document with instructions to that person.  In any case the administrator of the system should read through these mitigations and ensure that they are taking place.

The following threats were ignored in the design of this system but are explicitly registered to help future analysis and in order to explain why we believe we don't have to take them into account at present.  If these threats matter in your system then backup-cloud as currently designed may not be for you.  Alternatively you may want to add improvements to backup-cloud to protect against them, either in your install or by contributing to the project.

| attackers may attack underlying cloud platforms and use control of them to access data | (obviously attacks to the specific cloud systems used should be taken into account)  - since the original data is already stored in the cloud, a person with access to the cloud system could access that |
