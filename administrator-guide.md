This guide is aimed at people setting up or administrating a backup-cloud install.  

## initial configuration

For the backup system to work you must create several definitions and resources

* an S3 bucket in which the backup data can be stored before being moved offline
* SSM definitions which direct the backup system to the correct folder in the correct S3 backup for storing backups
* at least two public keys that will be used for encrypting the backups
* IAM definitions giving appropriate permissions to appropriate actors

## Adding a new Public Key

New public keys are generated by the key holders following the [Instructuctions for Key Holders](instructions_for_key_holders.mdinstructions_for_key_holders.md).  

In the backups S3 bucket, in the `config` folder you must place the key named as `<key_name>`.pub.  You must ensure you remove any outdated keys.
